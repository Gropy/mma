I stand in the middle of it facing a being twice my size, yet somehow I have to defeat this foe and show my might.\n\nI hold just my shortsword, with it I run directly towards the creature. It doesn't seem prepared for my charge, and as I approach it, it sways its hands around trying to grab me. A quick dive below it allows me to avoid getting caught, and using my sword I do two quick slashes at both its ankles. While I tumble away from it, I hear a crash behind me and just like that, it is over."
 giants.0011.desc.b:0 "I stand in the crude village of the giants, around me gather my men and the locals in a circle. I stand in the middle of it facing a being twice my size, yet somehow I have to defeat this foe and show my might.\n\nWith just a shortbow in my hands I began loading an arrow, and as I started to pull on the string the giant facing me started moving its enormous legs. With just instinct and precision, one arrow flew, two arrows flew, and three arrows flew. And just like that, the giant crashed in front of me, it had an arrow in its eye, neck and chest.\n\nThe fight was over, and the other giants didn't seem angry; a mutual respect was found"
 giants.0011.desc.c:0 "I stand in the crude village of the giants, around me gather my men and the locals in a circle. I stand in the middle of it facing a being twice my size, yet somehow I have to defeat this foe and show my might.\n\nThey bleed just like any other creature, I thought as I grabbed my axe tight and stared down the giant. Just like any other foe I started running face first towards it, and at the same time it started moving its enormous legs as well. The giant then began stretching its hand towards me, and as soon as we made contact I rammed my axe into its palm. As it started shoving me back, I grabbed my side knife, spun my body around and towards it. As soon as I could I stabbed the beast in the neck as it fell down towards me.\n\nJust like that it was over, the other giants didn't seem angry; a mutual respect was found."

I stand in the middle of it facing a being twice my size, yet somehow I have to defeat this foe and show my might.\n\nWith a trusty spear in hand, I stood fast as the giant started moving its enormous legs towards me. Standing in the outer part of the ring, I rammed the spear into the chest of the beast as it approached me. But just that wasn't enough, and my entire body started sliding backwards as the giant kept moving forward. After a couple of meters I used my other hand to take a spear from a soldier who was watching us. The giant wasn't ready for it, because in mere seconds I had the spear up its throat.\n\nJust like that it was over, the other giants didn't seem angry; a mutual respect was found."
