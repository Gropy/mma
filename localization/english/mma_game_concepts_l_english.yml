 game_concept_dragons_desc:0 "Wyverns, which some might mistake as dragons from the tales of old, is merely just another animal on our planet. Wyverns are in the family of lizards, yet show territorial behavior like a bear.\n\nThe animal exists across the world and the average size is between a pig and horse, but varies from region to region.\n\nHumans have attempted to capture Wyverns and use them as [men_at_arms|E], this is pricey in lives and coins, but many have managed.\n\nThey use their front legs and fangs to fight, and therefore are strong against lightly armored enemies, such as [skirmishers|E] and [archers|E]."
